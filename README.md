# A Deeper Look At Git
A practice project for practicing more advanced commands than just the $ git add, $ git commit and $ git push commands I've mostly been using.

<hr/>

### Focus  
- Changing history:
- $ git commit --amend
- $ git commit --amend -m "<message>"
- $ git rebase <base>
- $ git rebase -i <base>
- Use [$ git rebase -i --root] to edit all commits without actually changing the base
- Splitting Up a Commit using rebase and then reset
- Using amend and rebase menu to edit commits, reword commits, squash commits, etc
- Passing in relative commit references like HEAD~2 as arguments to commands
- Branching, remote branches and pointers 
- Forcing a push to remote
- Never alter the history of a publically pushed repo
